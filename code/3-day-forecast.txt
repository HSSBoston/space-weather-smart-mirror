A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Apr 26-Apr 28 2023 is 5.00 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Apr 26-Apr 28 2023

             Apr 26       Apr 27       Apr 28
00-03UT       2.67         3.00         4.00

18-21UT       2.67         3.67         3.67     
21-00UT       3.00         3.67         2.67     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storming is likely 28 Apr due to
combined effects of a negative polarity CH HSS and the 24 Apr CME.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-16 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Apr 26-Apr 28 2023

              Apr 26  Apr 27  Apr 28
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Apr 26-Apr 28 2023

              Apr 26        Apr 27        Apr 28
R1-R2           10%           10%           10%
R3 or greater    1%            1%            1%

Rationale: A chance for isolated R1-2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts
will persist through 28 Apr primarily due to ARs 3288 and 3289.
